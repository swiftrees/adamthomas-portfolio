  "description": "HEYi innovates custom product design by integrating artificial intelligence into the creative process, making it possible for users to design their own unique products like phone cases, wall art, and t-shirts. My next stages of development include re-designing the creation page to be even easier to use, by automatically fitting the design to the print template and removing the editing features unless required by the user.
